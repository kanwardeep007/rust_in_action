And we’re off! Well, actually we’ve been off since yesterday. I fully expected today’s post to have been written in Scotland, but unfortunately, we haven’t made it there quite yet! I’ll just have to wait another day to get my hands on a hog roast sandwich from my favorite place in Edinburgh.

We started out our trip yesterday but through computer glitches on the aircraft we ended up back at the same gate we started at in Chicago. Not an auspicious beginning! With some juggling we were able to re-route ourselves to Newark and then on to Edinburgh (fingers crossed) to see Cheryl’s sister and brother-in-law. So that’s where we are now, Newark.

We’ll be in Edinburgh for a few days then head north to the Highlands for a week of relaxation, some hiking, looking at lochs, and probably more than a few drams of whisky. I am pretty excited about it and hopefully next week I’ll be bringing you lots of good photos of all of those.

In the meantime, just take a look at that pig in the window up above. A stop at Oink is a must for me every time we visit Edinburgh. It’s sooooooooo good. Oink is one of those food shops where when you see it you think, this is so simple, why hasn’t anyone done this back home? Slap a roasted hog in a window and just pull pork off of it for sandwiches. I know I’ve written about this place before, but Oink really is one of the things I always look forward to.

Our time in Edinburgh this year is also overlapping with one of our friends from back in DC. He’s never been able to get to Oink when he’s visited so I told him this is the time and it’ll be extra special since he’s going with us.

See you next week from the other side of the Atlantic!
